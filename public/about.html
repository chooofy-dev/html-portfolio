<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Logan Pendleton, and I want to thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio!</p>
<p>I am currently teaching myself how to code using online courses through <a href=https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?>Udemy's Full-Stack Web Development</a> 
  course, taught by Angela Yu. I really hope you enjoy perusing the site and learning about me!</p>
<h2>Get to know me!</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in the state of Ohio, which isn't as bad as everyone says it is. I mean, sure walking outside is like stepping into Caelid, but the people here are very friendly!
  In fact, I see people giving out free vaccines by the I-77 Underpass everyday! And if you are a football fan, like myself, you have the incredible chance to root for a record-breaking
  quarterback on the Cleveland Browns every Sunday. (I don't actually know if he's broken any records, but you'd think 24 sexual misconduct allegations should be a record.)
  In all honesty, I would love to leave Ohio someday, but for some reason, us Ohioans aren't allowed to leave the state without passing a series of rigorous tests that allows us
  to mingle with people of the 49 states. Don't worry, I am well-versed in these tests as I've already taken them more than dozen times, and each time I get a little closer to freedom!</p>

<p>Okay, now time for the real, "about me".</p>
<p>I graduated from high school in 2014, having been homeschooled through Quaker Digital Academy online. During my senior year, I began my first job as a freelance sportswriter for our local 
  newspaper, the <a href="https://norwalkreflector.com/">Norwalk Reflector.</a> Unfortunately, I believe the majority of what I published has been removed from the site, as they have cleared much 
  data from their servers. I was able to find a piece about the <a href="https://norwalkreflector.com/news/96497/logan-greszler-buckeyes-shouldnt-be-worried-about-offensive-production/">Ohio State
  Buckeyes</a> and my employee <a href="https://norwalkreflector.com/photo-single/61818/?mode=team">headshot.</a> </p>

<p>After my time as a sportswriter, I worked at our sister newspaper, the <a href="https://sanduskyregister.com/">Sandusky Register</a> as a page designer. In that department I used Adobe InDesign
  and Libercus to design the sports section of the newspaper. This was my favorite job I've had to date. As fun and sexy as writing is, being able to design something thousands of people would see
  every day was really thrilling! Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of money in the newspaper industry - especially at a local level, and I left that job after only 8 months.</p>

<p>My next job was totally different than anything I had done before, and yet still related to sports. I became a maintenance supervisor at a local sports park owned by Cedar Point, called Sports
  Force. While this was an entirely new "field" of work (pun intended), I threw myself into it. During the late spring through late fall the facility would host tournaments (mostly baseball, softball
  and soccer), that would include up to 150 teams. As a maitenance supervisor, my duties included landscaping, maintaining the artificial turf fields, converting fields from one sports to another
  (because you don't use bases in soccer or goals in baseball), and cleaning the facility grounds and bathrooms (please do not ask, there are horror stories I have buried deep inside).</p>
